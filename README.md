Sorting Algorithms that I'm proficient in.<br>
Algorithms implement sorting of an array with known size.

## Bogosort (Random) Sort
Keeps shuffling the array until sorted.

## Bubble Sort
Keeps checking two subsequent data until the extreme value ends up at either one of extreme end. Repeat until everything is sorted.

## Quick Sort
Keep dividing the array into partitions and change the array around a pivot. Done recursively until a single element left.
